# Image_Compression
Uses tensorflow compression to input a random image and compress it without losing size or pixels

1. Image compression and decompression is done using tensorflow compression models
2. A custom image can be loaded otherwise a default image is used for demostration
3. The model can be chosen based on the level of compression, that we require
	a. hific-lo (Low level compression)
	b. hific-mi (Medium level compression)
	c. hific-hi (High level compression)
